# OSPF & Secure HTTPS Lab with Cisco and Juniper Hardware

This project showcases the configuration of OSPF routing and secure HTTPS traffic exchange 
using real Cisco and Juniper devices. The lab environment was set up to simulate a real-world 
network topology, ensuring secure data transmission and efficient routing within the Commons LAN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Lab Objectives:**
OSPF Routing Protocol: Configured OSPF routing between devices to establish efficient path selection across the network.
HTTPS Traffic Exchange: Implemented HTTPS for secure web traffic using NGINX web servers, complete with CA-signed certificates for secure communication.
Real Hardware: Utilized real Cisco and Juniper devices in a lab environment for hands-on experience with network configuration.
Load Balancers & DNS: Configured load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across web servers and set up DNS to resolve domain names for secure access.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lab Setup:**
Devices: Juniper SRX routers, Cisco routers, and switches.
Network Configuration: Configured VLANs, routing, and DNS.
Security: Deployed secure communication through HTTPS using CA-signed certificates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Objectives Achieved:**
Designed and deployed a secure network topology with routing and security features.
Configured web servers with HTTPS, load balancing, and DNS to support secure communication and ensure scalability.
Set up routing information and ensured connectivity within the Commons LAN (100.64.144.0/24).
